## Setup

Developed in Visual Studio Code using the [Remote-Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) extension. To start the container, open `docker-compose.yml` and select `Docker: Compose Up`. Then find the `river-maps_dev` container and right-click it, choose `Attach Visual Studio Code`. This will open a new window within the container. The first time you run the container you will need to install the Python extension, and choose the Python interpreter at `/usr/local/bin/python`.

To run the processing script run the following in the VS Code terminal:

```bash
python process.py --help
```
